Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns.

In financial services, AI might be a chatbot that can answer customer queries, ML could be a system that detects fraudulent transactions by learning from historical data, and DL might be used for analyzing unstructured data like documents or images for compliance purposes."""

Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include credit scoring (predicting default risk based on customer data) and fraud detection (classifying transactions as legitimate or fraudulent).

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in data without labels. Examples include customer segmentation (grouping customers based on behavior) and anomaly detection (identifying unusual patterns without prior examples).

Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties. Examples include algorithmic trading systems and chatbots that improve through user interactions."""

Model: A mathematical representation of a real-world process, trained on data to make predictions or decisions.

Feature: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena. In credit scoring, features might include income, age, and credit history.

Label: The correct answer for supervised learning. In fraud detection, the label would be 'fraudulent' or 'legitimate'.

Training: The process of teaching an algorithm using historical data.

Inference: Using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Algorithm: A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem. Examples include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines."""

RAG retrieves relevant information from external databases or documents in real-time and provides this context to the model. It's ideal for scenarios requiring up-to-date information, such as regulatory compliance or current market analysis.

Fine-Tuning involves retraining a model on domain-specific data to specialize its knowledge and behavior. It's better for tasks requiring deep domain expertise, such as specialized financial document analysis or industry-specific language understanding.

Choose RAG when information changes frequently and accuracy is critical. Choose fine-tuning when you need specialized behavior and have sufficient domain-specific training data."""
